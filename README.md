# good-line
### Version 1.0.0


## About

`good-line` is a minimal mode-line configuration that aims to
replicate some of the features of the [doom-modeline](https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline) package.

This is a fork of [mood-line](https://gitlab.com/jessieh/mood-line). I wanted to fix several issues, but
haven't got an answer from so the fork.

## Features

* Clean, minimal design

* Anzu and multiple-cursors counters

* Version control status indicator

* Flycheck status indicator

* Lightweight with no dependencies

## Preview

## Installation

To enable `good-line`, place this in your configuration file after loading the package:

Disabling `good-line` can be accomplished by toggling `good-line-mode` off.
